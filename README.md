# adicity
A custom, argument based language engine built in Python :snake:

This engine can be used to create any custom language you want! The syntax is based on functions, where every keyword is a function: even variables (which simply have zero arguments). This allows for neat layering of arguments without start/end tags!

Take a look at the [cole-wilson/golfity](https://github.com/cole-wilson/golfity) project for an actual implementation of the parser.

I took a lot of inspiration from example parsers, but the design is my own.

Adicity also provides a REPL environment for any compatible languages installed via pip:
